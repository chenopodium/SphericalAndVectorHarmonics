# Spherical and Vector Harmonics Visualization

This project provides a dynamic visualization of **spherical and vector harmonics**, commonly used in fields such as quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and wave propagation in elastic solids. The simulation explores scalar and vector spherical harmonics, depicting wave behaviors in a visually interactive way, useful for educational purposes and scientific research.


## Features
- **Visualization of Scalar and Vector Harmonics:** Choose between scalar and vector spherical harmonics, visualizing their properties in an elastic medium.
- **Interactive GUI Controls:** Adjust wave parameters, amplitude, color schemes, and more to explore wave propagation, resonance, and interference.
- **Real-Time Animation:** Observe the dynamic evolution of wave functions and vector fields, representing longitudinal and transverse waves in an elastic solid.
